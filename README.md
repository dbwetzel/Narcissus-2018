# Narcissus-2018

This is a Max patcher (cycling74.com) for performance of Thea Musgrave's "Narcissus" (1987) for flute (or clarinet) and digital delay. 

This implementation is based on my dissertation research into interactive electroacoustic works for clarinet and obsolete technology. It is built on a modified version of my "Interactive Event Manager" system (built in Max) intended to facilitate "Standardized Realizations for Electroacoustic Performance" (Standard REP).
